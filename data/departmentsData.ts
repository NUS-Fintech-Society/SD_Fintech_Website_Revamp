            " <p>In 2006, Joel Greenblatt published his now-famous book, The Little Book that Beats the Market. In it, he describes a value investing strategy that he calls the Magic Formula. The unique feature of Magic Formula Investing is that it uses only two financial metrics, Return on Capital (ROC) and Earnings Yield (EY) to select a portfolio of stocks. Amazingly, according to Greenblatt, his Magic Formula Investing strategy could achieve an average of 30.8% in annual returns over 17 years when tested on the US market, far exceeding the market index — the S&P 500 — which returned 12.4% each year on average over that same 17-year time period.</p><p> Taking inspiration from Greenblatt’s Magic Formula, we decided to use ROC and EY as the only two features when training our machine learning models. Furthermore, since we found that the Magic Formula has yet to be extensively studied in our local (Singapore) context, we decided to apply this value investing strategy to SGX stocks and framed it as a machine learning problem. In this project, we explored using a variety of models including SVMs, KNNs, Neural Networks, and Gradient Boosted Models. Our best performing model achieved an accuracy of 86% in predicting outperformance of SGX stocks against the market index STI.</p><b>Article:</b><a href='https://medium.com/@nusfintech.ml/beating-the-singapore-stock-market-with-the-magic-formula-aa62989fda7d'> https://medium.com/@nusfintech.ml/beating-the-singapore-stock-market-with-the-magic-formula-aa62989fda7d</a> <b>Members:</b> <p>Kleon Ang, Vinod ,Hans Neddyanto Tandjung, Nixon Widjaja</p>",

            '<p>In this project, we sought to train a computer vision model to detect the location and severity of car damages in order to give an estimate of the cost of repairs, which could help insurance firms process claims faster and detect fraudulent claims. For the model training, we gathered around 140 images of damaged cars with either scratches or dents. To train the damage detection model, we identified scratches and dents in images and labeled them with VGG Image Annotator. </p><p>For the training of the model, we fine-tuned a Mask R-CNN Model that was trained on the MS COCO object detection problem as a starting point to finetune the model with our dataset of damaged cars. With a very small dataset at around 140 images, we decided to augment our images to add more variety to the dataset. This helps the model in capturing some of the patterns under different angles, different lighting conditions and different image resolutions. </p><p>For the location detection, we trained another Yolov5 model on 3 classes, namely front, back and side. We did not train location detection using Mask R-CNN as we only needed to know whether the damages are front, side or back and hence instance segmentation was not really necessary. </p><p>Using Flask and REST API, we integrated the MaskRCNN and YOLOv5 models into a web application that enables end users to upload car images and receive model inference results. </p><b>Article:</b><a href="https://medium.com/@nusfintech.ml/car-claims-insurance-technology-insurtech-4ffbe2c948c5">https://medium.com/@nusfintech.ml/car-claims-insurance-technology-insurtech-4ffbe2c948c5</a><b>Members:</b><p>Daniel, Amateus, Chester, Nielsen, Zhili</p>',
