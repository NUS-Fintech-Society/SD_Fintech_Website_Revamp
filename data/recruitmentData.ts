          answer:
            'If the situation becomes better in semester 2, then we will have offline meet-ups and physical events. The regular meeting session depends on which department you are a part or and the type of project you have been assigned to. If you are in Machine Learning or Blockchain, you will have weekly meetings/training sessions. As mentioned in the call, the Machine Learning Department will be conducting those on Saturdays. While working on a project, the workload and frequency of meet-ups will increase to even twice or thrice the norm. As for Software Development, meetings can be weekly or biweekly meetings depending on the project and its deadlines. For Operations, the meetings will be ad hoc. However, we do have a tight schedule, so do expect the meetings and workload to be equivalent to that of taking an additional module!',
