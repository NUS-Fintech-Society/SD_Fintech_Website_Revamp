## Prerequisites

1. Node.js
2. npm

## Key packages and dependencies

1. [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
2. [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
3. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
4. [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/)
5. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo locally.
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install` in the root folder of your
   cloned repo.
3. Run `npm run dev` to launch the server locally.
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see
   the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on
[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This
endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are
treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead
of React pages.

## Workflow

We follow a
[branching workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow#:~:text=The%20core%20idea%20behind%20the,without%20disturbing%20the%20main%20codebase.)
where developers create a new branch and then make changes to it directly on the
main repo.
